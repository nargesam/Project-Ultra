# Project-Ultra
A neural machine translation model to decipher enigma codes to plain english using an encoder-decoder sequential model. 

I used a charachter level one-hot vector encoding and LSTM to decipher Enigma sequences to plain english. 

## Run model

After you downloaded the repo: 

```
git clone https://github.com/nargesam/Project-Ultra.git
```

Create a conda enviroment: 

```
conda create --name enigma python=3.7
```

and then activate your enviroment: 
```
conda activate enigma
```

Please install the requiremenets from docs: 

```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To check the model, run the notebooks/enigma_challenge.ipynb

# Project-Ultra
A neural machine translation model to decipher enigma codes to plain english using an encoder-decoder sequential model. 

I used a charachter level one-hot vector encoding and LSTM to decipher Enigma sequences to plain english. 

## Run model
To check the model, run the notebooks/enigma_challenge.ipynb
